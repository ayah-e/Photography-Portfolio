            Welcome to my photography portfolio! My name is Ayah Elsais, and I am a photographer who loves to capture moments and tell stories through my lens. I specialize in using custom film simulations on my Fujifilm x100v camera to recreate the nostalgic and classic look of film photography.

While I have always had a soft spot for street photography, I have recently found a new passion in organizing creative portrait shoots. I enjoy the challenge of bringing my subjects' personalities and visions to life through thoughtful planning and execution. Whether it's playing with light and shadows, experimenting with different angles and compositions, or incorporating interesting props and backdrops, I always aim to create a unique and memorable photo.

When it comes to my style, I love to keep things simple and classic. I believe that a good photograph doesn't need to be overly edited or complicated. Instead, I focus on capturing the beauty in the everyday and showcasing the natural essence of my subjects. My goal is to create timeless and authentic photographs that can be cherished for years to come.

Thank you for taking the time to view my work, and I hope you enjoy browsing through my portfolio as much as I enjoyed creating it. If you're interested in working with me, please don't hesitate to reach out!
